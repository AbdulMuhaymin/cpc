This is the backend for Circumbinary Planet Catalogue - a flask web app for system, stellar and planetary parameters of exoplanetary system in multiple (two or more) star system.

The web app is currently available at: [http://cpc.pythonanywhere.com/](http://cpc.pythonanywhere.com/) - this is a permanent address.

Before I used a simple tunnel from my localhost server and that's why this address was changing rapidly. However, I deployed it to a permanent solution called pythonanywhere. You can still edit it, add or remove objects. When we want to move it to a more permanent and production-grade server, we can simply copy the .db (database file).
